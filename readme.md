<h1><b>Mesothelioma Prediction Using Gradient Boosting</b></h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
This repository contains code for predicting mesothelioma using gradient boosting machine learning algorithms. Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs, most commonly the lungs and chest wall. Predicting mesothelioma can aid in early diagnosis and intervention, potentially improving patient outcomes.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
Mesothelioma prediction is a crucial task in the medical field for early detection and treatment planning. This project utilizes gradient boosting algorithms, a powerful machine learning technique, to predict the likelihood of mesothelioma based on various features such as demographic information, medical history, and exposure to asbestos.


<h3>Dataset</h3>
The dataset used in this project contains anonymized patient data including demographic details, medical history, asbestos exposure information, and mesothelioma diagnosis status. The dataset is not included in this repository due to privacy concerns.


<h3>Methodology</h3>
Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique that builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous one. The gradient boosting algorithm used in this project is implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python.
